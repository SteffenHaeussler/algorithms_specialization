# algorithms_specialization

My implementation of algorithms from the [coursera/stanford course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)
and tested with the ["official tests"](https://github.com/beaunus/stanford-algs)

Following algorithms were part of the course:

Currently, the following modules have been implemented:

## Course 1 - Divide and Conquer

- [Karatsuba multiplication](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/algorithms_specialization/tree/master/course_1/week_1/multiplication)
- [Count inversion](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/algorithms_specialization/tree/master/course_1/week_2/inversion)
- [Quicksort](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/algorithms_specialization/tree/master/course_1/week_3/quicksort)
- [random selection](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/algorithms_specialization/tree/master/course_1/week_4/random_selection)

## Course 2 - Graph algorithms

- [Kosaraju's algo](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/algorithms_specialization/tree/master/course_2/week_1/kosaraju)
